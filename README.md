# Security Project

This web application allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using various encryption methods. The tool offers a user-friendly interface to quickly perform encryption or decryption operations, ensuring a seamless and interactive experience.

## Features
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Encrypt and decrypt text using a variety of encryption methods.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, intuitive design with input fields for text and key, making the process simple for users.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Autoplay Background Sound**: Upon loading the website, a background sound plays automatically to enhance user experience.
- **Glitch Text Animation**: Unique glitch effects on the heading and buttons, adding a modern touch to the interface.
- **Footer & Branding**: Clear branding with a footer linking to the developer's website.

## Getting Started
To get the project running locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have a modern web browser like Google Chrome or Firefox installed. No additional software is required.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/security-project.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd security-project
    ```
3. Open the index.html file in your preferred browser:
    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

## File Structure
```
security-project/
│
├── index.html         # Main HTML file for the web application
├── styles.css         # CSS file for styling the web page
├── script.js          # JavaScript file for functionality
├── audio.mp3          # Background audio file
└── back.jpg           # Background image for the webpage
```

## How It Works
- **Encryption**: Users can enter any text and a key in the designated input fields, and the application will encrypt the text using the selected encryption method.
- **Decryption**: After encryption, users can input the same key to decrypt the text back to its original form.
- **Background Sound**: A background audio file (audio.mp3) plays automatically when the website is loaded, creating an immersive experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts based on the screen size, ensuring a great experience across devices.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and content of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling for a modern and visually appealing interface.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality for encryption, decryption, and interactive features.
- **Audio**: Background audio to enhance user interaction.

### Autoplay Sound Support
Modern browsers like Google Chrome may restrict autoplay for non-muted audio. The background sound is set to autoplay and loop, but some browsers might require user interaction to start the audio.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement more encryption methods for added functionality.
- Add custom themes or skins to enhance user experience.
- Provide a downloadable version for offline use.
